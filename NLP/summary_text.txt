The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) at the center of 
our Solar System, composed primarily of hydrogen (about 73%) 
and helium (about 25%). It generates energy through nuclear fusion,
converting hydrogen into helium in its core, which reaches temperatures
of approximately 15 million degrees Celsius. The Sun's surface 
temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius, and it emits energy
mainly as visible light and infrared radiation, crucial for life 
on Earth. It is roughly 1.4 million kilometers in diameter,
making it about 109 times wider than Earth
